            <p>
              Our Maps application makes it easy for you to find the perfect route between any 
              two places on Earth! To get started, you'll need to know the longitude and latitude 
              coordinates of both your starting point and your destination. Don't worry if that 
              sounds complicated - it's actually pretty simple!
            </p>
            <p>
              Longitude and latitude are like a special address system for the entire planet. 
              Latitude tells you how far north or south you are from the equator, while longitude 
              tells you how far east or west you are. Together, these two numbers can pinpoint 
              any location on Earth with incredible accuracy!
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you've entered both sets of coordinates, our smart mapping system will calculate 
              the best route between your two points. The application will analyze different possible 
              paths and show you the most efficient way to get from Point A to Point B.
